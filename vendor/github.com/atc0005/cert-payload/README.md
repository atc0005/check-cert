## Overview

This library provides support and functionality for encoding and decoding
certificate metadata payloads in JSON format.

Using this library, the `check_cert` plugin (from the `atc0005/check-cert`
project) creates fixed format version payloads. Those payloads (using a
different library), are embedded in monitoring plugin output where they can
later be extracted and decoded and then unmarshalled back into a specific
format version of a native Go type provided by this project.

This library exists to allow the `check_cert` plugin (and other client code)
to easily generate certificate metadata payloads and various other tools to
unpack them for analysis, reporting and actionable/automation purposes.

## Status

While attempts are made to provide stability, this codebase is subject to
change without notice and may break client code that depends on it. You are
encouraged to [vendor](#references) this package if you find it useful until
such time that the API is considered stable. You are also encouraged to only
use tagged (non-alpha/beta) releases for the same reason.

The specific certificate metadata payload format versions provided by this
project are *intended* to be supported indefinitely once the format is
declared stable. Any breaking changes to a format would be provided by
releasing a new format version with those changes.

> [!WARNING]
>
> `format0` is an unstable/development format version used for testing changes
> in behavior prior to *potentially* including them in a later stable format
> version. You are encouraged to use a stable format version (e.g., `1`)
> instead of using this version.

Top-level library constants are provided which identity the oldest and newest
stable format versions along with separate constants which identify the oldest
and newest format versions regardless of stability expectations. See those
constants for more information.

## Contributions

This library has a very narrow focus. While PRs may be accepted to resolve
typos, logic errors and enhance documentation, behavioral changes and feature
additions will likely be rejected as out of scope. If there is any doubt,
please [open a new
discussion](https://github.com/atc0005/cert-payload/discussions/new/choose)
and ask for feedback.

## Features

- support for generating a JSON payload from a specified metadata payload
  format version
  - this can be generated by calling the `Encode` function from a specific
    format version or by calling the top-level `Encode` function and
    specifying a valid format version number (e.g., `0` or `1`)
- support for decoding a given (valid) certificate metadata payload
  - the intent is to support decoding any given payload matching the set of
    supported format versions (e.g., `0`, `1`)
  - the caller provides an instance of a specific format version of
    the certificate metadata payload and the `Decode` function for that
    format version is used
  - once a format version is stable, the intent is to support creating and
    decoding it using this library indefinitely
    - this should allow the sysadmin using the `check_cert` plugin to specify
      what version of the payload format they wish to create
    - this should allow the sysadmin using a reporting tool to consume a
      certificate metadata payload generated by the `check_cert` plugin in the
      same fixed version as the one they asked the `check_cert` plugin to
      create
    - this process should continue to work as-is until the sysadmin decides to
      explicitly change the certificate metadata payload format version
      they're working with; updating this dependency should not break payload
      generation or consumption

## Additional notes

For additional details, please see the `formats.md` doc file for design notes
and potential future feature implementation work. See also
[GH-46](https://github.com/atc0005/cert-payload/issues/46) for initial
implementation notes and related GH issues.

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Examples

### Imports

Add this line to your imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"

  payload "github.com/atc0005/cert-payload"
)
```

and pull in a specific version of this library that you'd like to use.

```console
go get github.com/atc0005/cert-payload@v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest stable tag available to get started:

```console
go get github.com/atc0005/cert-payload@latest
```

See <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/atc0005/cert-payload> for specific examples.

See <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/atc0005/cert-payload?tab=importedby> for
projects that are using this library.

### Encoding a payload

See the `check_cert` monitoring plugin from the `atc0005/check-cert` project
for an example of how a certificate metadata payload is generated and embedded
within plugin output (for later retrieval and parsing).

### Decoding a payload

See the Nagios XI API example in this repo for how to combine the use of this
library with the `atc0005/go-nagios` library to extract, decode and unmarshal
an embedded payload to a specific format version of a certificate metadata
payload.
