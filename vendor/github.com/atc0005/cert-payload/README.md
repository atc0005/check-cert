## Overview

This library provides support and functionality for encoding and decoding
certificate metadata payloads in JSON format.

Using this library, the `check_cert` plugin (from the `atc0005/check-cert`
project) creates fixed format version payloads. Those payloads (using a
different library), are embedded in monitoring plugin output where they can
later be extracted and decoded and then be unmarshalled back into a specific
format version of a native Go type provided by this project.

This library exists to allow the `check_cert` plugin to easily generate
certificate metadata payloads and various other tools to unpack them for
reporting purposes.

## Status

While attempts are made to provide stability, this codebase is subject to
change without notice and may break client code that depends on it. You are
encouraged to [vendor](#references) this package if you find it useful until
such time that the API is considered stable.

The specific certificate metadata payload format versions provided by this
project are *intended* to be supported indefinitely once the format is
declared stable. Any breaking changes to a format would be provided by
releasing a new format version with those changes.

## Contributions

This library has a very narrow focus. While PRs may be accepted to resolve
typos, logic errors and enhance documentation, behavioral changes and feature
additions will likely be rejected as out of scope.

## Features

- support for generating a JSON payload from a specified metadata payload
  format version
  - this can be generated by calling the `Encode` function from a specific
    format version or by calling the top-level `Encode` function and
    specifying a valid format version number (e.g., `0` or `1`)
- support for decoding a given (valid) certificate metadata payload
  - the intent is to support decoding any given payload matching the set of
    supported format versions (e.g., `0`, `1`)
  - the caller provides an instance of a specific format version of
    the certificate metadata payload and the `Decode` function for that
    format version is used
  - once a format version is stable, the intent is to support creating and
    decoding it using this library indefinitely
    - this should allow the sysadmin using the `check_cert` plugin to specify
      what version of the payload format they wish to create
    - this should allow the sysadmin using a reporting tool to consume a
      certificate metadata payload generated by the `check_cert` plugin in the
      same fixed version as the one they asked the `check_cert` plugin to
      create
    - this process should continue to work as-is until the sysadmin decides to
      explicitly change the certificate metadata payload format version
      they're working with; updating this dependency should not break payload
      generation or consumption

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Examples

### Imports

Add this line to your imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"

  payload "github.com/atc0005/cert-payload"
)
```

and pull in a specific version of this library that you'd like to use.

```console
go get github.com/atc0005/cert-payload@v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest stable tag available to get started:

```console
go get github.com/atc0005/cert-payload@latest
```

See <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/atc0005/cert-payload> for specific examples.

See <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/atc0005/cert-payload?tab=importedby> for
projects that are using this library.

### Encoding a payload

See the `check_cert` monitoring plugin from the `atc0005/check-cert` project
for an example of how a certificate metadata payload is generated and embedded
within plugin output (for later retrieval and parsing).

### Decoding a payload

See the Nagios XI API example in this repo for how to combine using this
library and another library to extract, decode and unmarshal an embedded
payload to a specific format version of a certificate metadata payload.
