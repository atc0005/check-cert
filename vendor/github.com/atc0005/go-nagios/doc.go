/*
Package nagios provides common types, constants, package-level variables,
performance data and methods for use with Nagios plugins.

# OVERVIEW

This package provides common functionality for use by plugins used by Nagios
(and similar) monitoring systems. The goal is to reduce code duplication for
monitoring plugins written in the Go programming language.

# PROJECT HOME

See our GitHub repo (https://github.com/atc0005/go-nagios) for the latest
code, to file an issue or submit improvements for review and potential
inclusion into the project.

# FEATURES

  - Nagios state labels (e.g., StateOKLabel), state exit codes (e.g.,
    StateOKExitCode)
  - Nagios ServiceState type useful in client code as a way to map internal
    check results to a Nagios service state value
  - Nagios CheckOutputEOL constant useful for consistent newline display in
    results displayed in web UI, email notifications
  - ExitState type with ReturnCheckResults method used to process and return
    all applicable check results to Nagios for further processing/display
  - Optional support for collecting/emitting performance data generated by
    plugins
  - Supports "branding" callback function to display application name,
    version, or other information as a "trailer" for check results provided to
    Nagios
  - Panics from client code are captured and reported
  - Support for collecting multiple errors from client code
  - Support for explicitly omitting Errors section in LongServiceOutput
    (automatically omitted if none were recorded)
  - Support for explicitly omitting Thresholds section in LongServiceOutput
    (automatically omitted if none were recorded)
  - Automatically omit LongServiceOutput section if not specify by client code
  - Support for overriding text used for section headers/labels
