## Status

Alpha quality.

This codebase is subject to change without notice and may break client code
that depends on it. You are encouraged to [vendor](#references) this package
if you find it useful until such time that the API is considered stable.

## Overview

This package contains common types and package-level variables used when
developing Nagios plugins. The intent is to reduce code duplication between
various plugins and help reduce typos associated with literal strings.

## Features

- Nagios state constants
  - state labels (e.g., `StateOKLabel`)
  - state exit codes (e.g., `StateOKExitCode`)
- Nagios `CheckOutputEOL` constant
  - provides a consistent newline format for both Nagios Core and Nagios XI
    (and presumably other similar monitoring systems)
- Nagios `ServiceState` type
  - simple label and exit code "wrapper"
  - useful in client code as a way to map internal check results to a Nagios
    service state value
- Support for evaluating a given performance data value and setting the final
  plugin state exit code
- Support for parsing a given performance data metric string and generating
  one or more `PerformanceData` values
- Support for using a "branding" callback function to display application
  name, version, or other information as a "trailer" for check results
  provided to Nagios
  - this could be useful for identifying what version of a plugin determined
    the service or host state to be an issue
- Panics from client code are captured and reported
  - panics are surfaced as `CRITICAL` state
  - service output and error details are overridden to panic prominent
- Optional support for emitting performance data generated by plugins
  - if not overridden by client code *and* if using the provided
    `nagios.NewPlugin()` constructor, a default `time` performance data metric
    is emitted to indicate total plugin runtime
- Support for collecting multiple errors from client code
- Support for explicitly omitting Errors section in `LongServiceOutput`
  - this section is automatically omitted if no errors were recorded (by
    client code or panic handling code)
- Support for explicitly omitting Thresholds section in `LongServiceOutput`
  - this section is automatically omitted if no thresholds were specified by
    client code
- Automatically omit `LongServiceOutput` section if not specified by client
  code
- Support for overriding text used for section headers/labels

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Examples

Add this line to your imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"

  "github.com/atc0005/go-nagios"
)
```

and pull in a specific version of this library that you'd like to use.

```console
go get github.com/atc0005/go-nagios@v0.9.0
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest stable tag available to get started:

```console
