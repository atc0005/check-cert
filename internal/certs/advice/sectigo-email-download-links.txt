It looks like you are using a certificate provided by Sectigo (InCommon).

If this is correct, these are the download options available to you in the
"Enrollment Successful - Your SSL certificate for host1.example.com is ready"
email notification you received:

1. "as Certificate only, PEM encoded"
2. "as Certificate (w/ issuer after), PEM encoded"
3. "as Certificate (w/ chain), PEM encoded"
4. "Issuing CA certificates only > as Root/Intermediate(s) only, PEM encoded"
5. "Issuing CA certificates only > as Intermediate(s)/Root only, PEM encoded"

While these options can be confusing, they can be summarized as:

❌ FAIL: Option 4 when paired with Option 1 forms a misordered certificate chain.
➖ GOOD: Option 4 appended to Option 1 provides a usable chain.
✅ BEST: Option 2 is what sysadmins should use for best results.
